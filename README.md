# Blog Dashboard

This is the dashboard part of my blog api project.
Check out the main frontend [here](https://github.com/AndreiFlau/Project---Blog-Api-Frontend) and the dashboard frontend [here](https://github.com/AndreiFlau/Project---Blog-Api-Dashboard).

## Installation

First make sure that you have a .env file formatted like this:
DATABASE_URL=YOURDATABASEURL
PORT=8080
SECRET_KEY=SOMESECRETKEY

Make a database in the same format as seen in the [schema](prisma/schema.prisma)

Then clone the repo and run the commands below on the project's directory to get the backend going.

```powershell
  npm install
  npm run start
```
